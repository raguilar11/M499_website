```{r, echo=FALSE, }
library(ggplot2)
gapminder <- read.csv("/Users/Ricardo/Documents/Math499/assignments-raguilar11/gapminder.csv")
```
  
```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country, col = country)) +
  geom_point() + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position="none") + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Life Expectancy") + ggtitle("Trends in Countries' Life Expectancy")
```
  
It seems that most countries in the data set have a life expectancy that increases the year increase. There are countries' life expectancies that initially increased, but are in decline.
